**doge** is a simple motd script based on the slightly stupid but very funny
[doge meme][]. It prints random grammatically incorrect statements that are
sometimes based on things from your computer.

If you have [uv][] or [pipx][] (you should!), you can try out `doge` without installing
it permanently.\
Just type `uvx doge` or `pipx run doge` in your terminal to see if you enjoy it. üê∂\
If you do, `uv tool install doge` or `pipx install doge` to keep it around! üëç

## Features

* Randomly placed and colored random strings, complete with broken english.
* Awesome Shibe üòé in the terminal.
* Fetching of system data, such as hostname, running processes, current user
  and `$EDITOR`.
* If you have üåà [lolcat][], you can do this gem:\
  `while true; do doge | lolcat -a -d 100 -s 100 -p 1; done`
  (thx [hom3chuk][])
* stdin support: `ls /usr/bin | doge` will doge-print some of the executables
  found in /usr/bin. wow. There are also multiple command line switches that
  control filtering and statistical frequency of words. See `doge -h`, wow.
  * To use all dictionary words that start or end with "dog", try:\
    `egrep '(^dog|dog$)' /usr/share/dict/words | fgrep -v "'s" | doge`

## Notes

You need a terminal that supports 256 colors running on a system that supports
unicode.

The terminal Shibe was created with hax0r Gimp skills and [img2xterm][].

## Installation

There are several options for installing and running a Python CLI application
such as doge.

### Python-Based Install (Recommended)

The best way is to install doge directly from [PyPI][doge_pypi] with either
[uv][] or [pipx][]:

* `uv tool install doge` -- this is the recommended method, but you need [uv][]
  installed and configured.
  * [uv][] is usually the best way to install and run Python-based
    applications from PyPI, so if you don't yet have it, you should! üëç
  * To install newer versions, run `uv tool upgrade doge` or `uv tool upgrade --all`.
* The other option is to use [pipx][]: `pipx install doge`

Alternatively, you could also:

* Make a self-contained Python [zipapp][] with [pex][] or [shiv][], and put it
  in your `$PATH`, for example:
  * `shiv doge -c doge -o ~/bin/doge`
  * `pex doge -c doge -o ~/bin/doge`
* Install with *pip*, see Brett Cannon's
  [quick-and-dirty guide on how to install packages for Python][install_guide]
  for more information. TLDR; basically use your preferred Python and run:\
  `python3 -m pip install doge`

[zipapp]: https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipapp.html "zipapp ‚Äî Manage executable Python zip archives"
[pex]: https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex "pex - Python EXecutable (GitHub)"
[shiv]: https://github.com/linkedin/shiv "shiv - fully self-contained Python zipapps (GitHub)"
[install_guide]: https://snarky.ca/a-quick-and-dirty-guide-on-how-to-install-packages-for-python/ "A quick-and-dirty guide on how to install packages for Python"

Then, just add a call to `doge` at the bottom of your shell rc file.

If you don't want to install doge with the options above for whatever reason,
there is a proper `pyproject.toml` included, so inside a virtual
environment, `python -m pip install -e .` should work just fine.

### Package Managers And Linux Distributions

Your package manager or Linux distribution might carry a downstream **doge**
package.

If you choose this option, and experience any installation problems, then
please report them to your downstream package maintainer.

[doge_repology2]:  https://repology.org/project/doge-unclassified/versions "Versions for doge (Repology)"

Please note that it might take some time for downstream packages to catch up
with [PyPI][doge_pypi]. The recommended installation with [uv][] or [pipx][]
will always give you the latest version.
